Offering）是指通过发行加密代币（Crypto-Token）的方式来进行融资。 有许多区块链项目是以DAO的形式来展现，所以他们可以发行代币来代表该项目的一些收益权或者股份。 每个项目根据投资者投资金额比例来发行相应的代币给投资者， 而这些代币往往可以在一些数字代币的交易所里面进行交易。\r\n      </article>\r\n      <h2 class=\"sec-title\">ICO评级标准</h2>\r\n      <article class=\"content\">\r\n        ICO（英文简称Initial Coin Offering）是一种为加密数字货币/区块链项目筹措资金的常用方式， 早期参与者可以从中获得初始产生的加密数字货币作为回报。ico是国际上加密数字货币/区块链社区的产物， 为区块链的开发者筹措足够的运营资金，大部分ico筹措的资金都是比特币或者其他加密数字货币。 ICO一般会在区块链项目完成前进行，帮助项目筹措资金，以支持项目从创建团队到项目发行过程中所产生的费用。 对于一些大的区块链项目，会将从ico中筹措的部分资金存放到基金里以支持项目的持续发展，包括代币的初始分配模型等。 ICO参与者对于一个项目的成功非常重要，他们会在社区里为该区块链项目进行宣传， 使它产生的代币在开始交易前就获得流动性。 但ico的参与者最看重的依然是由项目发展或代币发行后价格升值带来的潜在收益。\r\n      </article>\r\n    </section>\r\n    <section class=\"advantage\">\r\n      <h2 class=\"sec-title\">我们的优势</h2>\r\n      <article

对于一些大的区块链项目，会将从ico中筹措的部分资金存放到基金里以支持项目的持续发展，包括代币的初始分配模型等。 ICO参与者对于一个项目的成功非常重要，他们会在社区里为该区块链项目进行宣传， 使它产生的代币在开始交易前就获得流动性。 但ico的参与者最看重的依然是由项目发展或代币发行后价格升值带来的潜在收益。\\n    \")])])\n}]\nvar esExports = {
